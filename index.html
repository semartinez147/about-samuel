    <h1>About Samuel</h1>
    <img src="./sam-prime.jpg" alt="Samuel wearing a child's plastic Optimus Prime mask">
    <p>I am a multi-purpose nerd; my biggest obsessions are reading sci-fi and fantasy, really complex board games and
        tabletop roleplaying games.  I was in marching band in high school.</p>
    <p> Back when I had free time, my favorite hobbies were origami, chainmail (as in metal rings, not spam) and model
        building, with a sprinkling of video games and backpacking. Now I have a son who I teach to make weird noises
        and not take the dogs as role models while I count down the days until he’s big enough to take hiking.</p>
    <p>One of my superpowers is a near-total lack of smell. You might think of losing one of your senses as a
        disability, but I am almost completely immune to being grossed out (infinitely useful as a new parent), and I
        can basically imagine my food tasting better if I don't like it. On the other hand, food that I don't think has
        gone bad can be a critical weakness.</p>

    <h2>Facts about Samuel</h2>
    <p>You might not believe it and only a handful of people know,but Samuel
    actually saved the planet! Samuel's secret background as a transformer
    made him the perfect canidate. When the world was under attack, he did what
    any hero would do and went Super Saiyan! </p>
